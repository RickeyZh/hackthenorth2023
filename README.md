## How It Works

### Posenet Sleep Detection

EarlyGoose utilizes PoseNet, a machine learning model, to detect if you are sleeping or not. Simply place your device in a suitable position, and EarlyGoose will monitor your sleep patterns and provide feedback.

### Gamification

We believe that making sleep fun is the key to better sleep habits. EarlyGoose offers a gamified experience where you can earn rewards, unlock skins, and achieve higher scores by maintaining a consistent and healthy sleep pattern. The more you sleep well, the more you progress in the game.
